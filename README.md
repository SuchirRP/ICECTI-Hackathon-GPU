# ICECTI 2023 Hackathon
### GPU Tech
GitHub repository containing starter sequential code and Problem statement for ICECTI 2023 Hackathon, hosted by Mahindra University in collaboration with NVIDIA.
This repositoty contains two files:
- `ProblemStatement.pdf` contains the following:
  - Introduction (Motivation to the topic)
  - Problem statemnt (Definition)
  - Mathematical formulation
  - Steps to apply

and

- `sequential.c` contains:
  - A sequential implementation of the Problem Statement in C.
  - **Note:** Places where double-precision has been used will need to be converted to single-precision in the source code for **Level 1** (as mentioned in `ProblemStatement.pdf`).
